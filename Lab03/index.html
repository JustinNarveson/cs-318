        <h2>Why the Packers?</h2>
        <p>The Packers are the most storied franchise in the NFL and hae been a successful small market team for a long time. I grew in southeastern Wisconsin and have been a lifelong Packers fan. I even own part of the team as they are the only team in the NFL that allows fans to buy shares of the team.</p>
        <h3>Greatest Players of All-Time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Aaron Rodgers</li>
            <li>Brett Farve</li>
            <li>Don Hutson</li>
            <li>Sterling Sharpe</li>
            <li>Reggie White</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Super Bowls</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>9 World Championships</li>
            <li>1966 vs. Kansas City Chiefs</li>
            <li>1967 vs. Oakland Raiders</li>
            <li>1996 vs. New England Patriots</li>
            <li>2010 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers</li>
        </ol>
        <p> The Packers have the most world championships if you are including the NFL-AFL merger. This makes them one of most successful franchises of all time and doing so in what is considered a small market of Green Bay. Green Bay is town of only 100 thousand which is impressive to have this much athletic success in such a small town compared to other cities with franchises.   </p>
